# python-tsla-analysis

Utilized python modules pandas, numpy, matplotlib, yfinance and sklearn to visualize tsla's closing price by plotting 
closing price along with 50 and 200 days moving averages and Bollinger Bands. I then ran and plotted a linear regression model, but given that my only regressor
variable was price, not much insight was gleaned. In future analysis, I should consider multi-linear regression models, as well as svm.
